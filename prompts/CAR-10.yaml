  Add new controller in Player context. It needs to implement endpoint which will return actual saldo of given player. We need to define strict rules of calculating saldo:
  - Exit point is always 0
  - Its increased by all the activites (connected to task typed as activity) with statsus completed (with value of task which is related to given acitivity)
  - Its decreded by all the activites  (connected to task typed as activity) with statsus canceled (with value of task which is related to given acitivity)
  - Its decrased by  all the activites (connected to task typed as duty) which were not completed (with value of task which is related to given acitivity)

  Isolate logic of calculation to some Provider. Controller should only be messenger
