date: 2025-09-28

content: |
  Create a `TaskStatusController` with a method `update` that handles the `POST /task/{uuid}/update` route. The method should:

  1. Retrieve the task by its UUID using the `TaskRepository`.
  2. Validate the request body to ensure it contains a `status` field with a value of type `TaskStatus`.
  3. Update the task's status and validate the entity.
  4. Persist the changes to the database.
  5. Return a JSON response indicating success or any errors encountered.

  Ensure the `TaskRepository` is implemented if it does not already exist.
