  Analyze all classes inside our contexts (Auth, Controller, Player, Session, Task) and modify classes in the given way:
  - Delete all comments
  - Do NOT EVER return response that is an complex array, if array is more complexed than simple list you have to create an dto class for this data in DTO/ directory of given context  
  - Do NOT EVER return errors like that $this->json(['error' => 'Player not found'], 404);, all the cases need to have specific exception which will be thrown
  - Do not create multiple classess in one file, all of the DTOS should be separate classess
  - Do not create multiple classess in one file, all of the Exceptions should be separate classess
