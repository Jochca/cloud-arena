date: 2025-10-01
content: |
  Modify TaskStatusController functionality to:
  - Validate that a player cannot finish a task with status "pending" (prevent Completed status when current status is Pending)
  - Create a TaskActivityService that creates TaskActivity records for given Task and Player
  - Only create TaskActivity if no other TaskActivity exists with status "in_progress" or "finished" for the same task/player combination
  - Set TaskActivity start date to now and end date to now + 24 hours
  - Add Player context to the UpdateTaskStatusPayload with UUID validation
  - Create TaskActivityRepository with method to find active activities
  - Update controller to use the service when task status changes to InProgress
  - Return appropriate error responses for validation failures and conflicts
